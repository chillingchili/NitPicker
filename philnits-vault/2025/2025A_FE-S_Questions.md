# 2025A_FE-S_1

For an 8-bit binary integer, which of the following is the operation that extracts the most significant 4-bits while making the other bits zero?

a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
d) Bitwise XOR operation with 00001111.
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Understand the goal

We want to keep the upper 4 bits unchanged and force the lower 4 bits to zero.

### Step 2: Apply bitwise AND logic

The AND operation outputs 1 only when **both** bits are 1. Using the mask `11110000`:

- Upper 4 bits: `x AND 1 = x` → original bits are preserved
- Lower 4 bits: `x AND 0 = 0` → forced to zero

Example: `10110110 AND 11110000 = 10110000` ✓

The other options fail: NAND inverts the result, OR with `00001111` sets lower bits to 1 rather than clearing them, and XOR flips bits rather than masking them.

Which of the following is the binary fraction that is the nearest equivalent to the decimal fraction 23.375?

a) 10111.011
b) 10111.110
c) 11101.011
d) 11101.110
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Convert the integer part

$23 \div 2$: repeated division gives $23 = 16+4+2+1 = 10111_2$

### Step 2: Convert the fractional part

$0.375 \times 2 = 0.75$ → bit **0**
$0.75 \times 2 = 1.5$ → bit **1**
$0.5 \times 2 = 1.0$ → bit **1**

So $0.375_{10} = .011_2$

### Step 3: Combine

$23.375_{10} = 10111.011_2$

# 2025A_FE-S_3

Which of the following is the most appropriate description of machine learning in AI?

a) It is a technology that enters specialized knowledge in a particular field into a computer, and has the computer infer by using the knowledge entered.
b) It is a technology that gives computers the ability to learn in the same way humans naturally learn, such as finding specific patterns from memorized data.
c) It is a technology that reproduces vital phenomena or evolutionary processes by using computers and machines.
d) It is a technology to give computers the ability to manage learning materials and learning by using a web system or other information technology so that people can learn interactively.
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Identify each option's description

- Option A describes an **expert system** (rule-based inference from encoded knowledge).
- Option B describes **machine learning** — the computer finds patterns from data on its own.
- Option C describes **evolutionary computation / simulation** (e.g., genetic algorithms).
- Option D describes an **e-learning system**.

### Step 2: Match to machine learning

Machine learning is specifically about algorithms that improve through experience by identifying patterns in data, without being explicitly programmed with rules. Option B is the correct match.

A hash table of size 11 uses open addressing with hash function $h(k) = k \text{ mod } 11$, and linear probing. The table shown below is created after inserting 4 values into an initially empty hash table. Which of the following is the sequence that represents a possible order in which the key values were inserted into the table?

[Table: index 2→79, index 3→14, index 4→35, index 5→92]

a) 14, 79, 35, 92
b) 79, 14, 92, 35
c) 79, 92, 35, 14
d) 92, 79, 14, 35
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Compute home slots

- $79 \mod 11 = 2$ → home slot 2
- $14 \mod 11 = 3$ → home slot 3
- $35 \mod 11 = 2$ → home slot 2 (collision!)
- $92 \mod 11 = 4$ → home slot 4 (collision if 2, 3, 4 occupied!)

### Step 2: Trace option B — 79, 14, 92, 35

1. Insert **79**: slot 2 empty → placed at 2 ✓
2. Insert **14**: slot 3 empty → placed at 3 ✓
3. Insert **92**: slot 4 empty → placed at 4 ✓
4. Insert **35**: slot 2 taken (79), probe slot 3 taken (14), probe slot 4 taken (92), probe slot 5 empty → placed at 5 ✓

This matches the table perfectly.

For a CPU with a clock frequency of 800 MHz, where one instruction is executed in an average time of 4 clock cycles, what is the CPU performance in MIPS?

a) 0.2
b) 20
c) 200
d) 3,200
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Recall the MIPS formula

$$\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Clock frequency (Hz)}}{\text{CPI} \times 10^6}$$

### Step 2: Substitute values

$$\text{MIPS} = \frac{800 \times 10^6}{4 \times 10^6} = \frac{800}{4} = 200$$

# 2025A_FE-S_9

When a CPU has a special register used in push and pop instructions, which of the following is an appropriate term for this register?

a) Instruction register
b) Program counter
c) Stack pointer
d) Status register
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Review CPU register functions

- **Instruction register**: holds the currently executing instruction.
- **Program counter**: holds the address of the next instruction to fetch.
- **Stack pointer**: holds the address of the top of the stack — used directly by PUSH and POP.
- **Status register**: stores flags like carry, zero, overflow.

### Step 2: Match to push/pop

PUSH and POP operate on the stack. The **stack pointer** is automatically incremented or decremented with each PUSH/POP operation, making C the correct answer.

# 2025A_FE-S_10

The table below shows the access times for the cache memory and main memory in systems A and B. Which of the following is the approximate hit ratio of the cache memory, when the effective access time and the cache memory hit ratio are the same for systems A and B?

[System A — Cache: 14 ns, Main: 80 ns]
[System B — Cache: 12 ns, Main: 90 ns]

a) 0.17
b) 0.20
c) 0.83
d) 1.00
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Set up the effective access time equation

Let $h$ = hit ratio. Effective access time:

$$T = h \times T_{cache} + (1-h) \times T_{main}$$

### Step 2: Set System A = System B

$$14h + 80(1-h) = 12h + 90(1-h)$$

$$14h + 80 - 80h = 12h + 90 - 90h$$

$$-66h + 80 = -78h + 90$$

$$12h = 10$$

$$h = \frac{10}{12} \approx 0.83$$

# 2025A_FE-S_11

Which of the following is a merit of migrating an internal business system to a cloud service?

a) If an internal business system that requires a very high level of availability is to be migrated to IaaS, all service providers guarantee high availability, so the migration is easy.
b) If an internal on-premises business system with company-specific functions is to be migrated to a system provided by SaaS, the migration of the company-specific functions also becomes easier.
c) If PaaS is to be used, platform management and OS updates are performed by the service provider, so the burden of installation and operation can be reduced.
d) If SaaS is to be used temporarily for the development or evaluation of an internal business system, a highly flexible development environment can be provided.
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Evaluate each option

- **A** is false — IaaS providers do not universally guarantee high availability; the customer is still responsible for their own architecture.
- **B** is false — SaaS provides standardized software, making it *harder*, not easier, to migrate unique company-specific functions.
- **C** is correct — With PaaS, the provider manages the underlying platform, OS, and middleware, reducing the operational burden on the customer.
- **D** is misleading — SaaS provides fixed applications, not flexible development environments; PaaS or IaaS would be more appropriate for development.

# 2025A_FE-S_12

In a system composed of two processing devices, what is the difference in availability between the two conditions below? The availability of each device is 0.9.

(1) System available if **at least one** device is running normally.
(2) System available only if **both** devices are running normally.

a) 0.09
b) 0.10
c) 0.18
d) 0.19
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Calculate availability for condition (1) — parallel (at least one)

$$A_1 = 1 - (1-0.9)^2 = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$

### Step 2: Calculate availability for condition (2) — series (both required)

$$A_2 = 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.81$$

### Step 3: Find the difference

$$A_1 - A_2 = 0.99 - 0.81 = 0.18$$

# 2025A_FE-S_14

In a system with preemptive priority scheduling (smallest number = highest priority), four processes have the following properties:

| Process | Arrival | Burst | Priority |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| P1 | 0 ms | 8 ms | 2 |
| P2 | 2 ms | 1 ms | 1 |
| P3 | 4 ms | 2 ms | 3 |
| P4 | 6 ms | 3 ms | 4 |

What is the average waiting time (in ms)?

a) 2.75
b) 3
c) 3.25
d) 3.5
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Simulate the schedule

- t=0: P1 starts (priority 2)
- t=2: P2 arrives (priority 1) → **preempts P1**
- t=3: P2 finishes → P1 resumes (priority 2, highest remaining)
- t=4: P3 arrives (priority 3) → P1 continues (P1 has higher priority)
- t=6: P4 arrives (priority 4) → P1 continues
- t=9: P1 finishes (ran 2 ms before preemption + 6 ms after = 8 ms total) ✓
- t=9: P3 runs (priority 3)
- t=11: P3 finishes
- t=11: P4 runs
- t=14: P4 finishes

### Step 2: Calculate waiting times

- **P1**: ran 0–2, preempted; resumed 3–9. Waiting = 3 - 2 = **1 ms**
- **P2**: arrived t=2, ran immediately. Waiting = **0 ms**
- **P3**: arrived t=4, ran t=9. Waiting = 9 - 4 = **5 ms**
- **P4**: arrived t=6, ran t=11. Waiting = 11 - 6 = **5 ms**

### Step 3: Average

$$\text{Average} = \frac{1 + 0 + 5 + 5}{4} = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75 \text{ ms}$$

Wait — that gives 2.75. Let me re-check P1's waiting time.

P1 ran from 0–2 (2 ms), was preempted at t=2. It resumed at t=3 and ran until t=9 (6 ms). Total run = 8 ms ✓. P1's total time in system = 9 - 0 = 9. Burst = 8. Waiting = **1 ms**.

$$\text{Average} = \frac{1+0+5+5}{4} = 2.75$$

a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.

When it takes 10 ns to copy a byte, which of the following is the approximate time (in ms) to copy the data for a $1024 \times 768$-pixel graphics screen with 24-bit color?

a) 22
b) 23
c) 24
d) 25
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Calculate total bytes

- Pixels: $1024 \times 768 = 786{,}432$
- Bytes per pixel: $24 \text{ bits} \div 8 = 3$ bytes
- Total bytes: $786{,}432 \times 3 = 2{,}359{,}296$ bytes

### Step 2: Calculate time

$$\text{Time} = 2{,}359{,}296 \times 10 \text{ ns} = 23{,}592{,}960 \text{ ns}$$

$$= 23.59 \text{ ms} \approx 23 \text{ ms}$$

# 2025A_FE-S_16

Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of an actuator?

a) It amplifies weak electrical signals sent from microphones, sensors, and similar devices.
b) It compares a given target value with a controlled value obtained from a sensor, and outputs an operation amount to match the controlled value with the target value.
c) It converts power from an energy source into rotation, translational motion, or other movements based on control signals.
d) It detects position, angle, velocity, acceleration, force, temperature, and similar parameters, and converts them into electrical information.
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Define each component

- **A** describes an **amplifier**.
- **B** describes a **controller** (e.g., PID controller).
- **C** describes an **actuator** — a device that converts electrical control signals into physical motion or action.
- **D** describes a **sensor**.

### Step 2: Confirm

An actuator is the output device in a control system. Motors, solenoids, and hydraulic pistons are all examples. Option C is correct.

# 2025A_FE-S_17

When ordering data is entered, which of the following is the appropriate method for checking whether the order date is a business day that is the same as or prior to the entering date?

a) Duplication check
b) Format check
c) Logical check
d) Sequence check
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Review input validation types

- **Duplication check**: detects duplicate records.
- **Format check**: verifies that data matches a required format (e.g., date as YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Logical check**: verifies that data makes sense in context — e.g., that a date falls within a valid range or is a business day relative to another date.
- **Sequence check**: verifies records are in the correct order.

### Step 2: Match to the requirement

Verifying that the order date is a business day and is on or before the entering date is a **logical check** — it requires comparing the value against contextual business rules.

# 2025A_FE-S_18

Of the functions provided by a DBMS, which of the following is a means for achieving protection for data confidentiality?

a) Checking referential constraints when the data is updated
b) Managing a transaction that combines a series of processes as a logical unit
c) Managing the data access rights of users
d) Placing an exclusive lock to data before updates
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Map each option to its purpose

- **A** → **Integrity** (referential integrity enforcement)
- **B** → **Atomicity / consistency** (transaction management)
- **C** → **Confidentiality** (access control — only authorized users can view/modify data)
- **D** → **Concurrency control** (prevents simultaneous conflicting updates)

### Step 2: Identify confidentiality

Confidentiality means protecting data from unauthorized access. Managing access rights (permissions/roles) is the direct mechanism for this.

Which of the following is the primary goal of conceptual database design?

a) To create a physical data model of the database
b) To define the logical structure of the database
c) To determine the exact data types for every database attribute
d) To implement database security measures
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Understand database design phases

- **Conceptual design**: high-level, implementation-independent model of the data and relationships (e.g., ER diagram). Focuses on defining what data exists and how entities relate.
- **Logical design**: maps the conceptual model to a specific data model (e.g., relational tables).
- **Physical design**: determines storage structures, indexes, data types.

### Step 2: Match options

Option B — defining the logical structure — best represents the outcome of conceptual design, which is to define the structure of the data in an abstract, logical way. Options A, C, and D belong to physical design or implementation phases.

# 2025A_FE-S_21

Which of the following is the clause that should be inserted into blank A of the SQL statement below in order to display the total sales data for each product that sold for at least $5,000?

```sql
SELECT ProductID, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails
[A]
```

a) `GROUP BY ProductID HAVING SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) >= 5000;`
b) `HAVING SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) >= 5000;`
c) `HAVING SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) >= 5000 GROUP BY ProductID;`
d) `WHERE SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) >= 5000;`
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Understand GROUP BY and HAVING

- `GROUP BY` groups rows with the same ProductID together.
- `HAVING` filters the groups **after** aggregation (unlike `WHERE`, which filters rows before grouping).
- `HAVING` must come **after** `GROUP BY` in SQL syntax.

### Step 2: Eliminate wrong options

- **B**: Missing `GROUP BY` — the query would not group by product.
- **C**: `HAVING` before `GROUP BY` violates SQL syntax.
- **D**: `WHERE` cannot filter on aggregate functions like `SUM()`.
- **A**: Correct — groups by ProductID first, then filters groups with total ≥ 5000.

# 2025A_FE-S_22

Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of the granularity of locks?

a) When large granularity is set for a large number of transactions to update the same data, the number of transactions that can be executed simultaneously increases.
b) When large granularity is set for all data in a table to be referenced, data referenced from other transactions can remain undisturbed.
c) When large granularity is set for data to be updated, the waiting times for other transactions increase, and the total throughput declines.
d) When large granularity is set, the number of data items included increases, and the number of locks that one transaction makes increases.
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Understand lock granularity

Lock granularity refers to the size of the data unit being locked (e.g., table > page > row). **Large granularity** = locking a larger unit (e.g., the whole table).

### Step 2: Evaluate each option

- **A** is false — large granularity **decreases** concurrency because more data is blocked per lock.
- **B** is partially misleading — a table lock would *block* other transactions, not leave them undisturbed.
- **C** is correct — large granularity locks more data at once, so other transactions must wait longer, reducing throughput.
- **D** is false — large granularity means **fewer** locks are needed (one big lock instead of many small ones).

# 2025A_FE-S_23

Which of the following is the most appropriate information for a router to determine the destination of an incoming packet?

a) Destination IP address
b) Destination MAC address
c) Source IP address
d) Source MAC address
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Recall router operation

Routers operate at **Layer 3 (Network layer)** and make forwarding decisions based on **IP addresses**. They consult their routing table using the **destination IP address** to determine the next hop.

### Step 2: Eliminate other options

- **MAC addresses** are used by switches at Layer 2 (within a single network segment).
- **Source addresses** are not used for forwarding decisions (they may be used for filtering/logging).

---

# 2025A_FE-S_24

In the OSI model, which of the following is the layer responsible for routing datagrams between hosts utilizing IP addresses across one or more networks?

a) Data link
b) Network
c) Physical
d) Transport
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Review OSI layer functions

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Physical | Bit transmission over a medium |
| Data link | Frame delivery within a single network (uses MAC) |
| **Network** | **Packet routing across networks using IP addresses** |
| Transport | End-to-end communication (TCP/UDP) |

IP operates at the **Network layer (Layer 3)**, which is responsible for logical addressing and routing.

---

# 2025A_FE-S_25

Which of the following is an appropriate explanation regarding Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

a) It converts MAC addresses into IP addresses.
b) It resolves domain names into its IP addresses.
c) It resolves IP addresses into the corresponding MAC addresses.
d) It translates IPv4 addresses into IPv6 addresses.
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Define ARP

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used within a local network to find the **MAC address** that corresponds to a known **IP address**. A host broadcasts "Who has IP X?" and the device with that IP replies with its MAC address.

### Step 2: Eliminate others

- **A** describes Reverse ARP (RARP).
- **B** describes DNS.
- **D** describes NAT64 or similar translation mechanisms.

# 2025A_FE-S_26

The administrator tests reachability of a remote host using [A] and determines the path that packets take to the destination with [B].

a) [A] netstat, [B] ping
b) [A] netstat, [B] traceroute
c) [A] ping, [B] traceroute
d) [A] traceroute, [B] ping
?
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Define the tools

- **ping**: sends ICMP echo requests to test **reachability** of a host.
- **traceroute** (or `tracert` on Windows): reveals the **path (hops)** packets take to reach the destination.
- **netstat**: displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics — not used for reachability testing.

### Step 2: Match to the blanks

- [A] = testing reachability → **ping**
- [B] = determining path → **traceroute**

---

# 2025A_FE-S_27

Which of the following is the attack that is classified as DNS cache poisoning?

a) False domain information is injected into the DNS server that is referenced by a PC, and it leads the user to a fake server.
b) In order to interrupt the target service, the attacker uses the DNS server as a steppingstone to send a large number of recursive queries.
c) In order to obtain internal information, the zone information stored in the DNS server is compiled and transferred.
d) The version information of the DNS server software is obtained to identify a security hole.
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Define DNS cache poisoning

DNS cache poisoning (also called DNS spoofing) is an attack where **corrupted DNS records are inserted into a resolver's cache**, causing users to be directed to malicious IP addresses when they look up legitimate domain names.

### Step 2: Match options

- **A** matches exactly — false domain info is injected into the DNS cache, redirecting users to a fake server.
- **B** describes a **DNS amplification/DDoS attack**.
- **C** describes **DNS zone transfer exploitation**.
- **D** describes **reconnaissance / version disclosure**.

# 2025A_FE-S_28

A given application only retrieves and displays user information from a database. Which of the following is the appropriate database access right assigned to the account the application uses?

a) Administrator right
b) Reference right
c) Update right
d) Update right and reference right
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Apply the principle of least privilege

The application only performs **SELECT** (read) operations — it retrieves and displays data, nothing more. It does not insert, update, delete, create, or drop anything.

### Step 2: Match to rights

- **Reference right** (SELECT only) is sufficient and appropriate.
- Granting Update or Administrator rights would violate the principle of least privilege and introduce unnecessary security risk.

# 2025A_FE-S_29

Which of the following is a merit in using SaaS?

a) No system access management needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning password initialization or policy is required.
b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security requirements for application development nor the design of storage volume for system logs is required.
c) No system operation needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning work procedures at the time of a failure or backup is required.
d) No system security management needs to be performed, and neither the creation of information security management rules nor the assignment of an administrator is required.
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Understand what SaaS offloads

With SaaS, the provider handles application development, infrastructure, and maintenance. The customer does **not** need to build or deploy the system — they simply use it.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option

- **A** is false — customers are still responsible for managing their own user accounts and access policies.
- **B** is correct — SaaS eliminates the need to construct the system; the provider handles application security requirements and infrastructure design.
- **C** is false — customers still need business continuity plans and must understand SLAs regarding backups and failures.
- **D** is false — customers still need to define internal security governance and assign administrators for their SaaS usage.

# 2025A_FE-S_30

Which of the following is an appropriate operation for user authentication that uses an IC card and a PIN?

a) Given that each user can be identified by an IC card, a common PIN is set for all users in order to reduce the management workload.
b) If an IC card is lost, a new IC card is issued, and after the PIN is reset, the lost IC card is deactivated.
c) The PIN is set by combining the numeric information imprinted on the surface of the IC card.
d) When an IC card is delivered, the PIN is not enclosed, but is notified to the user through another channel.
?
d) Bitwise XOR operation with 00001111.
### Step 1: Evaluate security of each option

- **A** is insecure — a shared PIN defeats the purpose of individual authentication; anyone with any card could authenticate as anyone else.
- **B** is partially correct in procedure but problematic in order — the lost card should be **deactivated first**, before issuing a new one. The order as stated leaves a window of vulnerability.
- **C** is insecure — deriving a PIN from visible card information makes it easily guessable.
- **D** is a security best practice — separating the PIN delivery from the card delivery (two-channel delivery) ensures that even if the card is intercepted, the PIN remains unknown.

# 2025A_FE-S_31

Which of the following is the most effective method of detecting unauthorized changes of the contents of a web server?

a) Communications to the web server are monitored to ensure that there is no communication other than HTTP and HTTPS.
b) The hash value of each file of the contents of the web server is stored and periodically compared with the hash value generated from each file.
c) The memory usage of the web server is checked periodically to ensure that a buffer overflow has not occurred.
d) The updated date of each file of the contents of the web server is stored and compared periodically with the updated date of each file.
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Compare detection methods

- **A** monitors protocols, not file content — it won't detect tampering.
- **B** uses cryptographic hash comparison. If a file is modified, its hash changes — this is a reliable, tamper-evident method.
- **C** monitors memory usage — unrelated to file content integrity.
- **D** compares file modification timestamps — these can be forged by an attacker; unreliable.

### Step 2: Confirm best answer

Hash-based integrity checking (e.g., using SHA-256) is the most robust and commonly recommended method for detecting file tampering.

# 2025A_FE-S_32

Which of the following is the function of a WAF?

a) Encrypting data and controlling access on web server
b) Inspecting and filtering HTTP requests
c) Managing user authentication and authorization
d) Scanning malware on a web server
?
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
### Step 1: Define WAF

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and analyzes **HTTP/HTTPS traffic** to detect and block malicious requests such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web attacks.

### Step 2: Match to options
